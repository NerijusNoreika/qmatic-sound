Chrome extension for QMATIC Queue management system. Adds funtionality to hear a sound when a new customer is added to the dashboard.

It works by watching the queue number with mutation observer. If number gets bigger, sound is played.

- Add watcher not only to profile queue, but to workplace queue (addmitedly more complex thing to do)

Pull requests are welcome.
